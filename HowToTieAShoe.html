		<p>Below you will find a step-by-step guide to tying a shoe. This is a very complex process, so pay close attention.</p>
	
		<ol>
			<li>Slip an individual item of footwear, commonly referred to as a "shoe", over one of your two feet.</li>
			<li>Once the shoe is fitted, pinch each of the shoe's shoelaces betwixt the thumb and index finger of each of your hands.</li>
			<li>Cross each shoelace over to the opposite side of the shoe so that they are hanging off the sides.</li>
			<li>Take the shoelace resting farthest from you and tuck it under the shoelace closest to you. Now <i>PULL</i> it!</li>
			<li>Take the shoelace you have just pulled through and create a "loop" shape. It should resemble the ear of an oryctolagus cuniculus.</li>
			<li>Next, take the other lonely shoelace and wrap it around the looped one, starting on the side facing you.</li>
			<li>This is where it gets tricky. After the unlooped shoelace is wrapped around the looped one, take your other hand, grab the unlooped lace (not directly from the end) and <i>PULL</i> it <b>underneath itself</b>.</li>
			<li>If you did this correctly, you should now have a <a href="https://agcfield.github.io/TiedShoe.jpg" target="_blank">tied shoe</a>. Now go walk somewhere.</li>
